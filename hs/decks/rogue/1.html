    <h2>Hello world</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This deck aims to build a board of small minions, while simultaneously completing the The Caverns Below Quest. It aims to play Crystal Core as quickly as possible, which will turn all of the minions into 5/5s and allow an attack for a large amount of damage. After playing Crystal Core, the bounce spells in the deck turn their focus to the deck's cheap charge minions, which can attack for five damage each time they are played.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Playing this deck requires you to plan ahead to the turn where you will be playing your Crystal Core. On that turn, your aim is to already have a board of minions that have been assembled by using Moroes and Violet Teacher to generate 1/1 tokens. You should bear in mind that at some point, you are likely to need to play one of your minions four time. This means you should look to prioritise the minion that will give you the most value over the course of the game. Swashburglar is often a good choice for this, due to all of the extra cards that it can give you. If you do play Swashburglar multiple times, be aware of your hand size. If the Quest triggers when you have ten cards in hand, you will not receive the reward! The deck does rely on the Quest being activated though, so do not try to force the value at the expense of simply completing the Quest.</p>
    <h3>Matchups</h3>
    <p>The Rogue Quest card, The Caverns Below, is one of the more interesting Quest cards in the game. In some ways it has two conditions, it has the stated condition that you need to play four Minions with the same name, but it also has the condition that most of your deck needs to comprise of small Minions. If the Minions in your deck are not small, then they will not get the benefit from Crystal Core, and will render the Quest pointless. There is a further problem to solve, which is that Crystal Core costs five Mana to play, which means that it will need to have an immediate impact on the board when it is played, or risk missing most of a turn. With those factors in mind, the deck needs to be aggressive, and the Minions can be badly statted in return for having strong Battlecry effects.</p>
