    <h2>Miracle Quester</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I swa this deck while browsing online trying to find some quirky deck. Hunter Quest + Starving Buzzard = Miracle. This deck is ment to combo card draw through starving buzzard and other cards in the deck</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>You would play this deck like a regular quest hunter but when you get to the lategame your goal is to get a tundra rhino and starving buzzard to stick on the board for you to draw and deal damage up to 22 in one turn. If you need to tech in any cards feel free to drop a raptor hatchling or two.</p>
    <h3>Matchups</h3>
    <p>I have not had a lot of experience with this deck yet. But i was playing against a quest mage earlier today who wasdoing nothing to keep board control. I was able to Houndmaster my Rat Pack, on the following turn i dropped a starving buzzard which the mage didnt consider when he fireballed the rat pack my hand was full and he conceaded. This deck tries for the miracle combos that make your opponent rage.</p>
