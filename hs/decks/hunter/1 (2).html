    <h2>Faster (a facelike hunter)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Everybody right now are building quest decks that are just so slow. right here is a deck that abuses the slow meta like my mom does after I skip thanksgiving dinner. </p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>For the mulligan you want 1 drops if you dont have one in your opening hand you already lost(turn one is where you make the questers you b*ch since they give up a turn to do nothing). Although this deck is about going face you need to keep board control at all times especially against pirates and quests rogues. Stubborn gastropod is your best friend in taunt heavy matchups if you know that your up against one make sure to mulligan for it. Good luck and have fun.</p>
    <h3>Matchups</h3>
    <p>This deck has good match ups against most of the current meta decks except for against warrior especially if the are the quest kind.</p>
