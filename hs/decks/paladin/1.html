    <h2>Mid Range Paladin</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In the current meta if you cannot win by turn 6 then you better have a strong finisher cause your opponents quest is about to pop off.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>This deck uses just good cards to out trade and value your opponent. The theory is that if you can use spikeridge steed on a card its value will carry you to the win. Great cards to use SpikeRidge steed on: Tirion, Acolyte of Pain, and Sunkeeper Tarim.</p>
    <h3>Matchups</h3>
    <p>I have not played this deck much but ideally you want to mulligan for a nice curve. Hydrologyst drops a 1 mana spell so use that to your advantige tocombo with wildpyromancer. Use doomsayer to kill early opponent tempo and then swing in with your buffed up minion.</p>
